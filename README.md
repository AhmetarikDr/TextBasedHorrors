It will work in python enviromets that are created in visual studio code.

You can open this folder in visual studio code (or any alternative if you know how to) and press "view" > "command palette". After that choose "Python:Create Enviroment..." and it should be ready.

i can make a executable version after finals with a game engine. maybe...

In this game you are an astronaut working on a spaceship, one day an alien monster attacks your ship and kills most of the crew. Your job is to simply survive and do whatever you want. You can try to kill the monster or just find a way to safely leave the ship.

Monster randomly travels across rooms, and if you happen to be in the same room as the monster a 'fight' starts. It's pretty simple, if you have a real weapon to damage such a monster you can try to attack. If you are unarmed however, you better run away.
