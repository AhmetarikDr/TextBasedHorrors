It will work in python enviromets that are created in visual studio code. (doesn't work at the moment)

You can open this folder in visual studio code (or any alternative if you know how to) and press "view" > "command palette". After that choose "Python:Create Enviroment..." and it should be ready.

i can make a executable version after finals with a game engine. maybe...
