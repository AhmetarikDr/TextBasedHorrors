It works in python enviromets that i created in visual studio code.

You can open this folder in visual studio code (or any alternative if you know how to) and press "view" > "command palette". After that choose "Python:Create Enviroment..." and it should be ready.

i can make a executable version after finals with a game engine. maybe...
