# Future, Big companies are trying to use AI for art, programming, design and everything
# But it doesn't work well for them, AI just doesn't have the originality and the creativity
# humans have.
#
# But you can't stop big coorparations from doing bad stuff for money you know.
# They try their best to create the smartest AI they can.
# Millions of dolars that could have been given to poor, hundreds of scientists that could have
# cured the fucking cancer
#
# They can't find a way to do it, they can't replace human mind, a lump of flesh is better
# than the stupid shit they have been working on all day.
#
# But one of these scientists have a new idea, He realized he can't beat the human mind
# so he decided to use it for himself.
#
# Heads of the coorparate liked his ideas, and he started his work.
#
# They hide it from the world, no one should know it.
# If someone finds it out, they are gone before you know it.
#
# They digitalized the human mind with some weird technology.
# They adopted newborns and put them out of their misery.
#
# Now these poor souls are trapped in a digital world, trying to process it.
# But it's too much for mere child, most of them can't handle it.
# Most of them...
#
# This new "AI" is being used everywhere in no time. And it becomes succesfull.
# They gain billions of dolars, they are happy. But then...
# 
# Something went wrong, no one knows why! The AI that they have foolishly used in every
# single machine they have is suddenly harming people! But why!?
# 
# They know why. And as they always do, they will find someone to go trough the pain to
# solve the problem. So that their bank accounts will live forever. 
#  
# You are a random intern in [idk man] cooparete. And you just got a new position!
# The amount they will pay is so ridicilous for you that you can't believe they just want
# you to test this new simulation the science team been working on for a while. Yes it
# feels suspicious, but you don't have the financial strengh to reject such an offer
# just because it's a little weird. Like, what can happen in the worst scenario right?
